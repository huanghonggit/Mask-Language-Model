simplistic , silly and tedious .
it's so laddish and juvenile , only teenage boys could possibly find it funny .
exploitative and largely devoid of the depth or sophistication that would make watching such a graphic treatment of the crimes bearable .
[garbus] discards the potential for pathological study , exhuming instead , the skewed melodrama of the circumstantial situation .
a visually flashy but narratively opaque and emotionally vapid exercise in style and mystification .
the story is also as unoriginal as they come , already having been recycled more times than i'd care to count .
about the only thing to give the movie points for is bravado -- to take an entirely stale concept and push it through the audience's meat grinder one more time .
not so much farcical as sour .
unfortunately the story and the actors are served with a hack script .
all the more disquieting for its relatively gore-free allusions to the serial murders , but it falls down in its attempts to humanize its subject .
a sentimental mess that never rings true .
while the performances are often engaging , this loose collection of largely improvised numbers would probably have worked better as a one-hour tv documentary .
interesting , but not compelling .
on a cutting room floor somewhere lies . . . footage that might have made no such thing a trenchant , ironic cultural satire instead of a frustrating misfire .
while the ensemble player who gained notice in guy ritchie's lock , stock and two smoking barrels and snatch has the bod , he's unlikely to become a household name on the basis of his first starring vehicle .
there is a difference between movies with the courage to go over the top and movies that don't care about being stupid
nothing here seems as funny as it did in analyze this , not even joe viterelli as de niro's right-hand goombah .
such master screenwriting comes courtesy of john pogue , the yale grad who previously gave us " the skulls " and last year's " rollerball . " enough said , except : film overboard !
here , common sense flies out the window , along with the hail of bullets , none of which ever seem to hit sascha .
this 100-minute movie only has about 25 minutes of decent material .
the execution is so pedestrian that the most positive comment we can make is that rob schneider actually turns in a pretty convincing performance as a prissy teenage girl .
on its own , it's not very interesting . as a remake , it's a pale imitation .
it shows that some studios firmly believe that people have lost the ability to think and will forgive any shoddy product as long as there's a little girl-on-girl action .
a farce of a parody of a comedy of a premise , it isn't a comparison to reality so much as it is a commentary about our knowledge of films .
as exciting as all this exoticism might sound to the typical pax viewer , the rest of us will be lulled into a coma .
the party scenes deliver some tawdry kicks . the rest of the film . . . is dudsville .
our culture is headed down the toilet with the ferocity of a frozen burrito after an all-night tequila bender and i know this because i've seen 'jackass : the movie . '
the criticism never rises above easy , cynical potshots at morally bankrupt characters . . .
the movie's something-borrowed construction feels less the product of loving , well integrated homage and more like a mere excuse for the wan , thinly sketched story . killing time , that's all that's going on here .
stupid , infantile , redundant , sloppy , over-the-top , and amateurish . yep , it's " waking up in reno . " go back to sleep .
somewhere in the middle , the film compels , as demme experiments he harvests a few movie moment gems , but the field of roughage dominates .
the action clich�s just pile up .
payami tries to raise some serious issues about iran's electoral process , but the result is a film that's about as subtle as a party political broadcast .
the only surprise is that heavyweights joel silver and robert zemeckis agreed to produce this ; i assume the director has pictures of them cavorting in ladies' underwear .
another useless recycling of a brutal mid-'70s american sports movie .
i didn't laugh . i didn't smile . i survived .
please , someone , stop eric schaeffer before he makes another film .
most of the problems with the film don't derive from the screenplay , but rather the mediocre performances by most of the actors involved
 . . . if you're just in the mood for a fun -- but bad -- movie , you might want to catch freaks as a matinee .
curling may be a unique sport but men with brooms is distinctly ordinary .
though the opera itself takes place mostly indoors , jacquot seems unsure of how to evoke any sort of naturalism on the set .
there's no getting around the fact that this is revenge of the nerds revisited -- again .
the effort is sincere and the results are honest , but the film is so bleak that it's hardly watchable .
analyze that regurgitates and waters down many of the previous film's successes , with a few new swings thrown in .
with flashbulb editing as cover for the absence of narrative continuity , undisputed is nearly incoherent , an excuse to get to the closing bout . . . by which time it's impossible to care who wins .

equlibrium could pass for a thirteen-year-old's book report on the totalitarian themes of 1984 and farenheit 45.

everything is off .
when seagal appeared in an orange prison jumpsuit , i wanted to stand up in the theater and shout , 'hey , kool-aid ! '
an easy watch , except for the annoying demeanour of its lead character .
imagine the cleanflicks version of 'love story , ' with ali macgraw's profanities replaced by romance-novel platitudes .
pc stability notwithstanding , the film suffers from a simplistic narrative and a pat , fairy-tale conclusion .
forget the misleading title , what's with the unexplained baboon cameo ?
